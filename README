% DESCRIPTION

OTR (Off The Record messaging, http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) is a protocol 
for end to end encryption to be used with different instant messaging protocol

This module, once loaded, will do the "man in the middle" at the server level
In other word, it will decrypt messages, so the server administrator can read
them.

This module will emit hook that allow mod_logmnesia and mod_archive to log 
encrypted message in plain text.

I recomand to use this module  in combisaison with log_mnesia to see messages
http://www.dp.uz.gov.ua/o.palij/mod_logmnesia/


% HOW IT WORKS

message are intercepted with the ejabberd's filter_packet hook, which is emit
when a message is about to leave the jabber server to his destination (client 
or other server). If this is an otr message this module read the message, 
decrypt it, end re-encrypt it with his own public key. The plain text message
is sent to other plugin using  user_send_packet and user_receive_packet hook 
that are used by plugin such as mod_logmnesia

% KNOWN BUGS

- Only the version 2 of the OTR protocol is suported. (But it should be easy
   to add support for version 1)

- Fragmented messages are not supported. (but should be easy to support

- Messages are logged twice,  first encrypted, then decrypted.  In order to
  solve that I would need a hook that filter message _before_ they enter in
  the server processing.

- If user verify fingerprint, he will see they doesn't match.  But common
  users generaly don't verify fingerprint


% WHY THIS MODULE

This module is only a proof of concept to show that end to end encryption 
will never work for lambda user.  Lambda user don't care about encryption,
so they will never verify their fingerprint.

TLS between XMPP entity is already a good security,  and users must trust
the XMPP server they use

I don't like automatic end to end encryption, because features like server
archive, and server cache, will not work anymore.


% INSTALL

 You need libotr (tested with libotr-3.0.0) from  http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/#downloads
 Example of compilation instruction (path must be fixed)

gcc otr_drv.c -o otr_drv.so -fpic -shared -lerl_interface -lei  -lotr \
  -L/usr/lib/erlang/lib/erl_interface-3.5.5.3/lib \
  -I/usr/lib/erlang/lib/erl_interface-3.5.5.3/include -I/usr/lib/erlang/usr/include \
  -L/opt/libotr/lib  -I/opt/libotr/include
erlc -W  mod_otr.erl

I suggest you to put the file in the ejabberd source directory if you have it.
also, the mod_otr.beam must be paced with other module binaries, and the otr_drv.so
with others .so files.
